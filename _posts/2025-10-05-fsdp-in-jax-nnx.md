If you find yourself with the daunting task of implementing production-level [FSDP](https://engineering.fb.com/2021/07/15/open-source/fsdp/) in JAX NNX, then this tutorial is for you. This notebook will guide you step by step through the process.

You will learn how to implement a fully working FSDP on TPU — with all critical operations JIT compiled — that evenly shards all weights across the devices together with DDP. Additionally, you will see how to use distributed checkpointing to save to/restore from disk or GCP bucket via Orbax, set up reproducible nnx.Rngs for noise generation and dropout, and maintain an EMA model that is also sharded.

Let's begin.
