Building on the model-based reinforcement learning successes in vision-based games and text-driven environ- ments, we consider two approaches. In the first, we finetune a TinyLlama model on a custom dataset of synthetic trajectories from the Ap- pWorld engine, combining semi-random API exploration with ChatGPT-driven user requests. In the second, we use a powerful off-the-shelf LLM in a zero-shot setting. Evaluating on held- out trajectories using object-match accuracy, BLEU, and ROUGE, we find that the general- purpose LLMs exhibit superior performance.</p> <p>You can find the details about our findings in the <a href="/assets/pdf/AppSim.pdf">final report</a> and see our code <a href="https://github.com/georgysavva/appsim" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> </body></html>
