I am a first-year Master's student in Computer Science at NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. I study machine learning. My research interests lie in multimodal learning, representation learning, image generation, and reinforcement learning.

Previously, I interned with Prof. [Lerrel Pinto](https://www.lerrelpinto.com/) working on robot learning at the NYU CILVR lab. Before that, I spent eight years in industry as a software engineer, specializing in backend engineering and distributed systems. I was a founding engineer at [Edwin.ai](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/edwin), a Y Combinator-backed EdTech startup. Additionally, I created an open-source library [Scany](https://github.com/georgysavva/scany) and served as the technical co-founder of [Scifind](https://www.linkedin.com/company/scifind/), a troubleshooting platform for bioscientists. I received my Bachelor's in Computer Science from the Russian University of Cooperation.
