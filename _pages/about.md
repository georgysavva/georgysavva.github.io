I am a first-year Master's student in Computer Science at NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. I work with Prof. [Lerrel Pinto](https://www.lerrelpinto.com/) at the CILVR lab. My research interests lie in multimodal learning, representation learning, image generation, and reinforcement learning.

I received my Bachelor's in Computer Science from the Russian University of Cooperation in 2021. I have eight years of experience working as a software engineer in industry, focusing on backend engineering, distributed systems, databases, and Python. I am an ex-founding engineer at [Edwin.ai](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/edwin), a Y Combinator-backed EdTech startup. I am the author of an open-source library [Scany](https://github.com/georgysavva/scany) and the former technical co-founder of a troubleshooting platform for bioscientists [Scifind](https://www.linkedin.com/company/scifind/).
