I am a computer science Master's student at NYU Courant. I am passionate about machine learning. I aim to study and research the mathematical foundations of deep learning, NLP, computer vision, and reinforcement learning. My goal is to build algorithms that can be reliably used in uncontrolled environments like autonomous vehicles, embodied AI, and complex video games.

I received my Bachelor's in Computer Science from the Russian University of Cooperation in 2021. I have seven years of experience working as a software engineer in industry, focusing on backend engineering, distributed systems, databases, and Python. I am an ex-founding engineer at [Edwin.ai](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/edwin), a Y Combinator-backed EdTech startup. I am the author of an open-source library [Scany](https://github.com/georgysavva/scany) and the former technical co-founder of a troubleshooting platform for bioscientists [Scifind](https://twitter.com/sci_find). I have self-taught foundations in reinforcement learning, NLP, and computer vision.
